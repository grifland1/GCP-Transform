# GCP-Transform
This application performs a best-fit transformation on a field survey point dataset to match a control point dataset. 

Most common uses include: 
-  adjusting new GCPs to exsiting survey control for aerial mapping projects.
-  fitting found survey monuments to record map coordinates.

Although it is intended to provide survey-grade best-fit solutions, end user assumes all risk.
